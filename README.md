Pirate Tic Tac Toe

For now this is the classic game you know and love. I will be adding some features to make it far more exciting than the usual game. Hence the name - it's a version that I imagine pirates would have used to make the game longer and more frustrating.

Planning

I planned this by first thinking of the functions I would need to use for different outcomes in the game. Win for X, Win for O and a draw.

By making the board an array I was easily able to iterate through the array each turn to look for an outcome.

The biggest challenge I encounted was checking for a draw. Although not perfect, I came around this by checking for a draw once nine moves have been made.
