Pirate Tic Tac Toe

For now this is the classic game you know and love. I will be adding some features to make it far more exciting than the usual game. Hence the name - it's a version that I imagine pirates would have used to make the game longer and more frustrating.

Planning

I planned this by first thinking of the functions I would need to use for different outcomes in the game. Win for X, Win for O and a draw.

By making the board an array I was easily able to iterate through the array each turn to look for an outcome.

The biggest challenge I encounted was checking for a draw. Although not perfect, I came around this by checking for a draw once nine moves have been made.


I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create this. I plan on adding features to this as I learn. 

Bugs
Once a game has ended. Players can still click on the board and manipulate the score. I'll fix that very soon. I will disable play until the restart button is used.


Lessons
I'm happy with the functionality of this game so far. It serves it's purpose well. As I learn I plan on adding to it and making it the version on tic tac toe that I want to play.


Future features
I would also like to add a fun feature (this is where the pirate part comes in) that on a players fourth turn, their first turn is removed from the board. On their fifth turn, their second turn is moved from the board. This will mean the game can go for much longer and there cannot be draw. Just how pirates like it!
